Dear Sir / Madam,

My name is Jonathan Casey, and I am writing in relation to the position of English Teacher with Renaissance International School for summer period, but open also to extension beyond this term. 

I am a 29 year old Irish native with a Bsc in Computer Science, and previously employed as a Software Engineer before relocating to Viet nam.
Currently I am based in Saigon, where I have been teaching from almost one Year. Currently I am teaching 7 days per week; Monday - Friday at Public Schools, and on the Weekends at Yola language center.
 
As the Public Schools begin to close for the summer, I am hoping to find teaching opportunity from Monday - Fridays for the months of June, July and August. Please note my avalability remains high during this period, with no summer vaction planned. 

I attached my CV for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you in the near future. Thank you.

sincerely
Jonathan
